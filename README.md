<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![22b84a9a-c2b0-4e4e-a894-6ebd8c63f875-yoshis-island](https://github.com/HowestDAE/dae16-Goncalo-Alexandre-Viveiros-Guilherme/assets/161451486/a0d049dd-e8cb-4728-9652-4f2713fdd39f)


Here's why:

* It's movement system is fun and seems challenging to implement
* I really like the egg mechanic
* I really like the game's art style
* I havent seen anyone else make it for the previous years

## My version

This section gives a clear and detailed overview of which parts of the original game I planned to make.

### The minimum I will most certainly develop:
* Yoshi's move set and Mario's bubble
* The 1-1 (Make Eggs, Throw Eggs) level including:
* Enemies
* Platforms
* Secrets
* Winged Clouds


### What I will probably make as well:
* Atleast 1 Bonus challenge from the Goal Ring
* Menu level selection

### What I plan to create if I have enough time left:
* Tutorial Level
* Remaining Bonus challenge's from Goal Ring
* 1-2 (Watch out Bellow!)
* Foreground and background animations.
